# Credit Card Approval Prediction Project

![Alt text](image.jpeg)

## Problem Statement

This project aims to predict credit card approval using machine learning and data analysis techniques. The goal is to develop a predictive model that helps banks assess the creditworthiness of applicants, reducing the risk of issuing credit cards to potentially unreliable clients. By leveraging customer data and machine learning algorithms, this project intends to provide insights and improve decision-making in the banking sector.

## Questions to Answer

1. What is the importance of predicting a good client for a bank?
2. How will this prediction impact the banking sector?
3. What gaps in current knowledge does this project address?
4. How can the proposed method be helpful for banks in India?

## Initial Hypotheses

Based on the questions, we hypothesize that:
1. Identifying reliable clients will significantly reduce the risk of bad debt for banks.
2. Accurate predictions will improve the efficiency of the credit approval process.
3. The project will reveal important features impacting creditworthiness, which can be used to enhance existing models.

For the machine learning track, we will develop multiple models and compare their performance using relevant metrics and visualizations to justify the best model.

## Data Analysis Approach

To prove or disprove our hypotheses, we will:
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and important features.
2. Use feature engineering techniques to create meaningful variables for our models.
3. Justify our data analysis approach with visualizations and statistical tests.

## Machine Learning Approach

For machine learning-based predictions, we will:
1. Utilize various algorithms to predict credit card approval.
2. Justify the most appropriate model based on performance metrics.
3. Perform necessary steps to improve model accuracy.
4. Compare at least four different models to select the best one.

The machine learning approaches will leverage customer information to predict credit card approval, enhancing the quality of credit judgments.

## SQL Queries

Using cleaned data, the following queries will be performed using MySQL or DuckDB:
1. Group customers based on their income type and find the average annual income.
2. Find female owners of cars and property.
3. Find male customers who are staying with their families.
4. List the top five people with the highest income.
5. Determine how many married people have bad credit.
6. Identify the highest education level and its total count.
7. Compare bad credit rates between married males and females.
